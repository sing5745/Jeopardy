When you first run the project you will encounter form where you will have to enter the name which takes you to the values.jsp which contains values of each question from 100-500.
Once you click the value it will take you to the questions.jsp which will show the question according to the value chosen. And daily doubles appear randomly during the selection of value.
It can appear once/ twice or none. I am not able to disable the links so they can be clicked as many times you want.
